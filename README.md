# my-little-honeypot

## Description

This repository aims to show how easy it is to code a telnet honeypot in order to
recovering IOT malwares, and thus, active Command & Control.

This code has been released espacially because of the conference I gave at the
INSHACK event in Lyon, France on April 6th 2017.

## Disclaimer

I can't be responsible if your system has been harmed by a malware because you did
something you did not expect. Humility is the first skill you need when you're
reversing malware. Never ever reverse a malware you can't handle.

Lastly, this code is dirty and I did not plan to maintain it.
